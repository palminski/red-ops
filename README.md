### Movie Tracking Site

Redops.club is a custom made movie tracking site made in laravel used by myself and my friends to keep track of movies we have watched together, whose turn it is to pick a movie, and rate movies picked by one another. It is a silly project that was made for fun in laravel. While it started out as a simple joke, happily we actually use it quite frequently! I am also quite happy with how the design ended up!

If you want to know what movies my friends and I have been watching feel free to check it out [here](https://redops.club/movie-queue)!
